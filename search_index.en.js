This doesn't have to be low level\nprogramming or assembly or anything like that, although that would help tremendously. If you have a decent\namount of experience in programming languages such as Python or Javascript, you may have to follow along\nslowly, but you should hopefully be able to understand the code.\nIf you would like to follow along with me, you will need\n\nthe nasm x86 assembler\nthe gcc compiler\nthe make build tool\n\nI leave the installation of these tools to you.\nGDB\nWhile optional, I would recommend you also install the gdb debugger. This was invaluable to me when\nwriting this post, as my code would frequently crash or justs not work. Using gdb is outside\nthe scope of this post, but there are plenty of guides online. If you do decide to use gdb, I would\nrecommending using layout asm, layout regs, and set disassembly-flavor intel; this will display\nthe register values and assembly code in Intel syntax in separate windows. You may find it annoying\nto type these commands in at the start of every debugging session, in which case you can copy\nthe following into .gdbinit in your home directory:\nset auto-load safe-path /\n\nset disassembly-flavor intel\n\nlayout regs\nlayout asm\n\nIntroduction\nTo execute a program, your CPU accepts machine code instructions. These are raw bytes that instruct the\nCPU to perform one of the low level operations it knows how to do -- such as access memory, perform\nbasic arithmetic, move data into registers, etc.\nWhile programmers did write raw machine code in some of the earliest days in computing, almost no one\nwrites raw machine code today. Machine code is incredibly difficult for humans to read, write, and understand\nbecause it is merely a sequence of numbers encoded in binary that is sent to the CPU. Imagine encoding the\nEnglish alphabet with the numbers 1-26 and trying to write a paper using those numbers in place of letters.\nWhile it is possible, it would take an exorbitant amount of time and likely be fraught with errors.\nThese early computer scientists soon developed assembly as an abstraction on top of machine code. Instead\nof writing the sequence of numbers that would encode machine code instructions, code would be written with\ntext that humans could better read and understand. Each line would encode one instruction and any arguments\nthat instruction would accept. Labels were also added so that code could refer to certain parts of the program\nin a simple way, allowing programmers to more easily implement loops, functions, conditional statements, etc.\nHowever, assembly cannot be executed by the CPU -- the CPU can only execute machine code. Thus, assembly must\nbe assembled into machine code by an assembler. An assembler is essentially a compiler from assembly to\nmachine code. This machine code can then be sent to the CPU and executed.\nAs assembly is only a light abstraction over machine code, it is highly processor-specific and low level.\nThat means that assembly code must take certain features of the CPU into account to work properly,\nsuch as the architecture, registers, addressing modes, data types, and more.\nWe will be writing code for the x86 architecture, targeting CPUs with 64 bit registers. This is usually succinctly\ndescribed as x86-64 assembly code.\nFurthermore, as we are not writing assembly for a bare metal application, we rely on interfacing with the operating\nsystem to perform many operations, such as opening, reading from, writing to, and closing files. The interface to\nperform these operations through the operating system are operating system specific, so we will be targeting Linux\nin this article.\nAssembly Basics\nWe will first review some preliminary aspects of assembly code that are required to read or write any assembly.\nRegisters\nMuch of assembly code performs operations with registers. Registers are small memory locations within the CPU that\nstore the data that the CPU performs operations on. For instance, when performing an add operation, one of the\noperands must be CPU register that the CPU will save the final sum to.\nCPU registers are typically either 8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit, or 64 bit. Most modern desktop processors today are 64 bit,\nand as stated before, we are writing 64 bit assembly code.\nThese registers are all referred to with special, and somewhat confusing, names in assembly code.\nThe table here lists all of the\nx86-64 registers.\nNote that although these registers are 64 bit, you can specifically access smaller portions of the registers.\nFor example, here are all of the subparts of the 64 bit rax register:\n\nrax : the full 64 bit register\neax : the lower 32 bits of rax\nax : the lowest 16 bits of rax\nah : the upper 8 bits of ax\nal : the lower 8 bits of ax / the lowest 8 bits of rax\nYou can find all of these names, as well as the names of the other registers, in the link above.\n\nNote that you cannot access the highest 32 bits of rax nor the highest 16 bits of eax directly.\nYou can compute their values using bit operations, but their values cannot be accessed directly.\nWe can move data into registers with the mov class of instructions.\nmov rax, 0xdeadbeef ; move the number 0xdeadbeef into rax\nmov eax, 42         ; move the number 42 into eax, the lower 32 bits of rax\nmov ax, 0xff        ; move the number 0xff into ax, the lowest 16 bits of rax\nmov ah, 0xf         ; move the number 0xf into ah, the high 8 bits of ax\nmov al, 0xa         ; move the number 0xa into al, the low 8 bits of ax\n\nInstructions\nWe should now discuss instructions.\nEvery line of an assembly program encodes exactly one assembly instruction. An instruction is an\none operation that a CPU executes. Most instructions additionally take one or more operands,\nwhich are arguments that specify the operation of the instruction. For instance, the mov\ninstruction showed above takes a register as its first operand and a number as its second operand.\nThis encodes the operation of moving the number into the register. There are different forms of\nmany instructions, however, that accept different operands; for instance, each line above is a\ndifferent form of mov, as it accepts a different size of register. This means that the machine\ncode number of the mov instruction is different on each line. Thus, each form of an instruction\nis encoded by a different number in machine code.\nWe do not have to worry too much about the different forms of instructions and their machine\ncode numbers to write simple assembly code, thankfully. Just be aware that there are many assembly\ninstructions and each instruction can take none, one, or more operands.\nThe mov instruction discussed above, generally, moves data from a source to a destination of equal\nsize in the form mov [dest] [src].\nSyntax\nAs a quick aside, I will mention that the assembly syntax we are using is only one of many. In\nother syntaxes, such at AT&amp;T syntax, the mov instruction would be of form mov [src] [dest].\nWe are using the NASM assembly syntax because it is simple and easy to read. Intel syntax is also\nvery common and looks fairly similar to NASM syntax. AT&amp;T syntax is very common as well, but\nit looks very different from NASM syntax and personally, I find it to be very noisy and difficult\nto read.\nMost handwritten assembly nowadays seems to use NASM syntax and the NASM assembler, as we are using.\nMore Instructions\nNow that we know what an instruction is, let us look at some common and useful assembly instructions\nthat we will make use of:\n\nmov [dest] [src] : move data from the source to the destination\nlea [dest] [mem] : loads a memory address into the destination register\nxor [src] [dest] : xor the data in the src register with the value given as dest\nadd [dest] [src] : add the number, register, or number in memory to the destination register\nsub [dest] [src] : subtract the number, register, or number in memory from the destination register\nimul [src] : do a signed multiplication between rax and the src register.\n\nNote that there are other forms of imul for smaller register sizes; if you use a 32 bit,\n16 bit, or 8 bit register as the src, then the corresponding size of the rax register\nwill be used in the signed multiplication\n\n\nmul [src] : do an unsigned multiplication between rax and the src register\n\nThe size correspondence as explained right above also applies here\n\n\ncmp [src] [dest] : compare the value in the src register to the value given in dest and\nset the corresponding flags\n\nWe will discuss flags in the next subsection.\n\n\njmp [label] : unconditionally jump to the given label\njl [label] : jump to a given label if the B (below) flag is set\njg [label] : jump to a given label if the A (above) flag is set\nje [label] : jump to a given label if the E (equal) flag is set\njne [label] : jump to a given label if the NE (not equal) flag is set\ncall [label] : call a function called label\nsyscall : Perform a syscall.\n\nWe will discuss what a syscall is later.\n\n\n\nFlags\nWhen you perform some operations, such as a cmp operation, the CPU will set some flags for you.\nThese flags cannot be read or written to directly, but are instead used for control flow with some\ninstructions. For instance, most languages have an if statement to select between two\ncode branches to execute depending on some condition. The following Python code,\na = 2\nif a &gt; 1:\n    a += 1\nelse:\n    a -=1\n\nwould translate to the following assembly,\n    mov rax, 2      ; move the number 2 into rax\n    cmp rax, 1      ; compare the values of rax and 1\n    jle sub_one     ; if rax is less than or equal to 1, jump to sub_one\n    add rax, 1      ; add one to rax -- the 'if' path\n    jmp exit        ; jump to exit\nsub_one:            ; the sub_one label\n    sub rax, 1      ; subtract one from rax -- the 'else' path\nexit:               ; the exit label\n\nIf rax is less than or equal to 1, then the jle [label] will execute and jump to the\nsub_one label. Otherwise, this instruction will be passed over, 1 will be added to rax,\nand the program will jump to the exit label to skip the subtraction instruction.\nYou don't have to worry about what flags there are and how they are set; just treat the\ncmp instruction as a comparison between two numbers, and follow that with whatever\njump-family instruction corresponds to the comparison you want to make. That is,\n\njl corresponds to &lt;\njle corresponds to &gt;=\njg corresponds to &gt;\njge corresponds to &gt;=\nje corresponds to ==\njne corresponds to !=\nThus, using the cmp instruction and the jump-family of instructions, you can implement\nconditional control flow to jump to different code branches depending on the value of some\nregister.\n\nThere are other jump instructions you can use as well as other instructions that set flags, but\nthis subset suffices for our purposes today.\nSyscalls\nI mentioned before that to perform many common operations, such as opening, reading from,\nwriting to, and closing files, we will have to interface with the operating system. This is\nbecause the operating system manages all of the hardware in a computer, including storage, and thus\nthe operating system manages the filesystem. Thus, if we want to interact with files, we must\nwork with the operating system. Whenever you open a file in a higher level language, it is\nultimately interfacing with the operating system in this way.\nAs we are working with Linux in our code, we will use the system call interface. This is\nultimately rather simple. We will just have to move some data into specific registers\nto tell the Linux kernel what operation we want to perform, as well as supply data\nto perform that operation, and then we use the syscall instruction.\nEach system call has a corresponding number. The ones that we will use are:\n\nread -- 0 : read from a file\nwrite -- 1 : write to a file\nopen -- 2 : open a file\nclose -- 3 : close a file\n\nWe move the number of the system call into rax, move other arguments into other specified\nregisters, and then use syscall to perform the operation.\nThink of a syscall as a function -- just a special function that the Linux kernel executes.\nMemory\nWith the basics of assembly instructions out of the way, we will discuss the basics of\nmemory that we will need.\nWe will have to allocate memory in our program for arrays, strings, numbers, and more.\nHowever, we won't deal with dynamically allocating memory (such as with malloc)\nor anything like that. We will just bake the memory we need into the executable program\nitself through the assembly equivalent of global variables.\nWe can allocate strings and numbers in NASM using the following syntax,\nhello_world db \"Hello, world!\", 0\nlife        db 42\ninteger     dd 0xdeadbeef\n\nThis generalizes to the following: [name] d[memory size] [value].\nYou might be asking what that [memory size] part means. That just means the number of bytes\nto allocate. Bytes in collections of sizes of powers of 2 have special names, such as the following:\n\nbyte : 1 byte / 8 bits\nword : 2 bytes\ndoubleword : 4 bytes\nquadword : 8 bytes\n\nTo shorten their names, doublewords and quadwords are often referred to as dword and qword\nrespectively.\nThus, the dd in the code sample above means a dword, or 4 bytes of memory, should\nbe allocated for integer.\nSections\nWe must now discuss sections of an executable program, as we must define these ourselves\nwhen writing assembly code.\nSections are parts of an executable that have different purposes. They are separated for\nsake of organization and permission differences when mapped into virtual memory upon\na program being run. You don't have to worry too much about what that means; just\nknow each section has a defined usage, and we have to put our code in each section\naccordingly.\nWe will be using the following sections:\n\nrodata : read only memory\ndata : read and writable memory\nbss : memory allocated upon program execution\n\nThe Linux kernel allocates this memory when we run the process, but the\nvalues aren't actually stored in the executable file as in the data\nand rodata sections. You don't have to worry too much about what this\nmeans.\nThis section is typically used for global arrays and other large contiguous\ndata structures in memory that don't have a predefined value at compile time.\n\n\ntext : code that is executed during runtime\n\nYou can think of the rodata section as storing global, constant variables;\nthe data section as storing ordinary global variables, and the bss section\nas storing global arrays with uninitialized memory at the start of program\nexecution.\nWriting Assembly\nWhew! That was a lot. You will probably have to refer to the above explanations several\ntimes while we actually implement the assembly program, and that is perfectly fine!\nAssembly is really complicated and requires a lot of low level knowledge.\nIf you already knew very little of the above knowledge, it will probably feel\noverwhelming.\nHello world!\nWe will begin by writing a simple hello world program to demonstrate\nthe skeleton of an assembly program.\n; soln.asm\n\n; tell nasm that we are writing a 64 bit program\nbits 64\n\n; read only data\nsection .rodata\n\n; data\nsection .data\n; Note that the 0 at the end appends a null-byte\n; to terminate the string\nhello_world db \"Hello, world!\", 0\n\n; uninitialized memory\nsection .bss\n\n; code\nsection .text\n    global main     ; export main\n\n; our main function\nmain:\n    ; Push the stack pointer. Don't worry too much about this\n    push rbp\n    mov rbp, rsp\n\n    ; Load the number 1 into rax. This denotes that we want to perform the\n    ; WRITE system call.\n    mov rax, 0x1\n    ; Move the number 1 into rdi. This denotes the file we want to\n    ; write to, and STDOUT has a file descriptor of 1 for (virtually)\n    ; all Linux processes\n    mov rdi, 0x1\n    ; Load the memory address of the hello_world string into rsi\n    lea rsi, [hello_world]\n    ; Load the number of bytes we want to write into rdx, which is the length\n    ; of our hello world string:\n    mov rdx, 13\n    ; Invoke the syscall\n    syscall\n\n    ; Pop the stack pointer back off and return from the main function.\n    ; Don't worry too much about this.\n    leave\n    ret\n\nThis is the hello world program in assembly. A little bit longer than in Python, yeah?\nYou should have the knowledge required to understand most of the above assembly code,\nthough it will likely still be confusing. The only thing I have not explained is the\nstack; that is because the stack is fairly complicated and confusing, and we won't\nbe making too much use of it in our code. Just know that the code at the top and\nbottom of functions pertains to maintaining the stack.\nBuilding\nWe will compile this using nasm, gcc, and make. make is an old build tool\nthat allows us to set build targets and dependencies in a compact way. Here is\nthe Makefile for our project,\n# Our main target is the 'soln' executable\nall: soln\n\n# When we have an object file from the assembly, link it with gcc\n# We also must turn off the PIE security feature for our code to link\nsoln: soln.o\n    gcc -o $@ $? -no-pie\n\n# Compile all assembly files into objects files with nasm, and include\n# debug information in the dwarf format\n%.o: %.asm\n    nasm -f elf64 -g -F dwarf $&lt;\n\n# A target to delete all of our object files and executables\nclean:\n    rm *.o soln\n\nWe can then build the program in the command line, as well as clean\nup all the object files and executables, with make:\n$ make\n$ make clean\n\nSolving the AOC Day 1 Part 01 Challenge in Assembly\nNow that we have a working skeleton for our program, let us examine the\nAdvent of Code Day 1 Part 01 challenge:\n\nSpecifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those two numbers together.\nFor example, suppose your expense report contained the following:\n1721\n979\n366\n299\n675\n1456\nIn this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299. Multiplying them together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct answer is 514579.\nOf course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?\n\nWe are given a list of numbers and told to find the pair that sum to 2020. The answer is then\nthe product of those two numbers.\nFirst, let's copy the numbers into a text file.\n# input.txt\n\n1630\n1801\n1917\n1958\n1953\n1521\n...\n\nIf you're following along, you can either get your input from the AOC website\nor you can copy mine from my\nsolution repository.\nReading from the file\nOur next job is to open the file and read the data into a buffer.\nThis will require us to first allocate a sufficiently long buffer, and then\nperform the two system calls to open the file and then read from it.\n; soln.asm\n\nbits 64\n\nsection .rodata\n    ; syscall numbers\n    NR_READ        equ 0\n    NR_WRITE       equ 1\n    NR_OPEN        equ 2\n    NR_CLOSE       equ 3\n\n    ; file access modes\n    O_RDONLY       equ 0\n    O_WRONLY       equ 1\n    O_RDWR         equ 2\n\n    ; default file descriptors\n    STDIN          equ 0\n    STDOUT         equ 1\n    STDERR         equ 2\n\nsection .data\n    inputfilename  db \"input.txt\", 0\n    inputfile      db 0\n    inputbufferlen equ 1024\n\nsection .bss\n    ; When we run the program, allocate inputbufferlen\n    ; worth of bytes for inputbuffer\n    inputbuffer    resb inputbufferlen\n\nsection .text\n    global main\n\nmain:\n    push rbp\n    mov rbp, rsp\n\n    ; open the input file\n    mov rax, NR_OPEN            ; set our syscall to 'open'\n    lea rdi, [inputfilename]    ; load the address of the filename\n    mov rsi, O_RDONLY           ; set read only\n    syscall\n\n    ; if the syscall succeeded, rax will be a positive number\n    ; representing the file descriptor. if it failed, it will\n    ; be a negative number indicating the error.\n    cmp rax, 0                  ; compare rax to 0\n    jl .exit                    ; if rax &lt; 0, there was an error, so exit\n\n    ; read the input file\n    mov [inputfile], rax        ; move the file descriptor into the global variable\n    mov rdi, [inputfile]        ; load the file descriptor into rdi\n    mov rax, NR_READ            ; set our syscall to 'read'\n    lea rsi, [inputbuffer]      ; load the address of our buffer into rsi\n    mov rdx, inputbufferlen     ; load the length of our buffer into rdx\n.read:\n    syscall                     ; read from the file\n\n    ; if the read succeeded, the number of bytes read will be put into rax\n    ; if it failed, rax will hold a negative number\n    ; we must check for the error and also continue reading until rax holds\n    ; 0, indicating that there are no bytes to read\n    cmp rax, 0\n    jl .cleanup                 ; if rax &lt; 0, there was an error, so exit\n    je .read_done               ; if rax == 0, we are done, so stop reading\n    ; calculate the next offset in the buffer to read into and adjust the\n    ; buffer length accordingly\n    add rsi, rax\n    sub rdx, rax\n    mov rax, NR_READ\n    jmp .read\n\n.read_done:\n    ; Add a zero to the end of the input from the buffer\n    ; to terminate the string\n    inc rsi\n    mov [rsi], byte 0\n    ; calculate the length of the string we read\n    mov rdx, rsi\n    sub rdx, inputbuffer\n\n    ; For now, just write the buffer to stdout so we can verify this worked\n    mov rax, NR_WRITE\n    mov rdi, STDOUT\n    lea rsi, [inputbuffer]\n    syscall\n\n.cleanup:\n    ; we must now close the input file descriptor if we opened it\n    ; if it is not 0, then we have opened the file and must close it\n    mov rdi, [inputfile]\n    cmp rdi, 0                  ; check if we opened the file\n    je .exit                    ; if inputfile == 0, we did not\n    ; we opened the file, so must close it using the 'close' syscall\n    mov rax, NR_CLOSE           ; set our syscall to 'close'\n    ; note that we already put the file descriptor into rdi\n    syscall\n\n.exit:\n    leave\n    ret\n\nWhen you assemble and run this in the terminal, you should see all of the\nnumbers in input.txt be printed out to the screen.\nConverting strings to integers\nNow that we have the list of numbers from the file, we have to convert the ASCII\nnumbers into their actual numerical values. This will be somewhat involved;\nwe are going to have to go byte-by-byte and extract each number into a\nsubstring, then convert that substring to its numerical value.\nIt might be helpful to consult an ASCII table\nfor this step.\nLet us first implement a function to take a string and convert it into a 4 byte\ninteger. For those who have experience with C, this is analagous to the atoi\nfunction in stdlib.h.\nAs an aside, it is helpful to know the x86-64 calling convention. This defines\nwhich registers represent which arguments to a function. The following are the\nregisters for the first four arguments, which will suffice for our purposes.\n\nrdi : 1st argument\nrsi : 2nd argument\nrdx : 3rd argument\nrcx : 4th argument\n\nAdditionally, when writing assembly, it is wise to write extensive documentation\nfor each function. Assembly is difficult to understand as it is; without extensive\ndocumentation and comments, it is virtually impossible for humans to parse.\n; soln.asm\n\n; ...\nsection .text\n    global main\n    global atoi\n\nmain:\n    ; ...\n    leave\n    ret\n\n; Interprets a string and returns its content as a positive integral number.\n; NOTE: the string should contain only ASCII digits and be null terminated.\n; NOTE: this assumes *little endian* format.\n; NOTE: this function does not handle negative integers.\n;\n; Parameters:\n;   * `rdi` : pointer to the start of the string\n;\n; Returns:\n;   * `rax` : 8 byte integer\natoi:\n    ; set up the stack frame\n    push rbp\n    mov rbp, rsp\n\n    ; set rdx and rax to 0\n    xor rax, rax\n    xor rdx, rdx\n\n; We are going to loop through all of the bytes of the string,\n; turn the ASCII digit into a number from 0-9, multiply the\n; existing number by 10, and then add it to the total number\n;\n; We will know to stop looping when the current byte is '0',\n; the null byte terminating the string\n;\n; This total number will be stored in rax for the duration\n; of the loop\n.next_byte:\n    mov dl, byte [rdi]          ; Get the next byte\n    cmp rdx, 0                  ; If rdx is the null byte, we are done\n    je .exit                    ; jump to exit\n    sub rdx, 0x30               ; subtract 0x30 from the ASCII digit to map it to 0-9\n    imul rax, 0xa               ; multiply the number by 10 to make space in the one's digit\n    add rax, rdx                ; add the digit to the sum\n    inc rdi                     ; increment our byte pointer to the next byte in the string\n    jmp .next_byte              ; loop\n\n; Upon exit, the 8 byte number is stored in rax\n.exit:\n    leave\n    ret\n\nParsing the input string into an integer array\nNow that we can parse strings into integers, let us map the string of numbers\nto an integer array. Even though our atoi implementation returns an 8 byte long,\nwe will treat all of the numbers as 4 byte integers, as they are quite small and it\nsaves memory.\nWe will need to add a new global variable for the integer array and its size, and\nthen implement a loop in main to grab a substring for each number, parse it\ninto an integer with atoi, and then add it to the array.\nTo grab the substring for each number, we will use a character array buffer.\nWe will push each byte of the substring to this buffer, then parse it into an\ninteger with atoi. You could push each character to the stack and\ncall atoi with a pointer to the string on the stack, but I have not\nexplained the stack in this post, so we won't do that here.\nRemember to comment out the old debug printing code for printing out\ninputbuffer.\n; soln.asm\n\nsection .data\n    inputfilename  db \"input.txt\", 0\n    inputfile      db 0\n    inputbufferlen equ 1024\n    intarraylen    equ 200\n    numberbuflen   equ 32\n\nsection .bss\n    ; When we run the program, allocate inputbufferlen\n    ; worth of bytes for inputbuffer\n    inputbuffer    resb inputbufferlen\n    ; Allocate intarraylen worth of dwords for\n    ; our intarray.

Your terminal attempts\nto print these bytes, but they just translate to weird symbols.\nTo check that the output is correct, pipe the program output to a file\nand then examine the hexdump as so:\n$ ./soln &gt; bytes\n$ hd bytes\n00000000  5e 06 00 00 09 07 00 00  7d 07 00 00 a6 07 00 00  |^.......}.......|\n00000010  a1 07 00 00 f1 05 00 00  c6 07 00 00 a7 07 00 00  |................|\n00000020  07 06 00 00 06 07 00 00  7e 02 00 00 db 05 00 00  |........~.......|\n00000030  b9 07 00 00 99 05 00 00  fc 05 00 00 f4 06 00 00  |................|\n00000040  17 06 00 00 4a 07 00 00  aa 07 00 00 cf 07 00 00  |....J...........|\n00000050  57 06 00 00 ec 06 00 00  c2 06 00 00 86 06 00 00  |W...............|\n00000060  ff 06 00 00 9b 07 00 00  a9 07 00 00 f3 05 00 00  |................|\n00000070  bf 03 00 00 ce 07 00 00  9d 06 00 00 d2 05 00 00  |................|\n# ...\n$ python -c \"print 0x065e\"\n1630\n$ python -c \"print 0x05d2\"\n1490\n\nEvery 4 bytes represents a 4 byte number in little endian format. That is,\nthe first 4 bytes 5e 06 00 00 translates to the 4 byte number 0x0000065e.\nWe can use Python to print these numbers in decimal and compare them\nto the numbers in the input.txt file. You can verify that these two\nnumbers are the 1st and 32nd numbers in the input.txt file, respectively.\nFeel free to check that more numbers match if you like.\nFinding two numbers that sum to 2020\nThere are a number of clever ways to find two numbers in the integer array\nthat sum to 2020, but for simplicity's sake, we will just bruteforce it with\nthe O(n^2) algorithm and try every possible combination.\nTo do this, we will have to\n\nmaintain two indices into intarray to get pairs of numbers\nloop through indices starting from the first index to the last index\nincrement the first index and repeat until we find a pair that sum to 2020\nexit out of the loop, print the numbers, and print their sum.\n\nTo print their sum, it will be easiest to use the printf function from\nlibc. Otherwise, we would have to reconvert our numbers into ASCII or\nrecalculate their initial substring index in our inputbuffer. Luckily,\ngcc will automatically link against libc, so we merely have to add\nthe format string to our .data section and write extern printf to\nimport the function.\nRemember to comment out the old debug printing code for printing out\nintarray.\n; soln.asm\n\nsection .data\n    foundpairstr   db \"Found pair: %d * %d = %d\", 10, 0\n    ; ...\n\n; ...\n\nsection .text\n    extern printf\n\n    global main\n    global atoi\n\nmain:\n    ; ...\n\n    ; For now, just write the intarray to stdout to verify this works\n    ; mov rax, NR_WRITE\n    ; mov rdi, STDOUT\n    ; lea rsi, [intarray]\n    ; mov rdx, intarraylen * 4\n    ; syscall\n\n    ; Our starting indices into intarray, held in r12 and r13\n    mov r12, 0\n    mov r13, 1\n.find_pair:\n    mov eax, [intarray+r12*4]   ; Move the first 4 byte number into eax\n    add eax, [intarray+r13*4]   ; Add the second number to get the sum\n    cmp eax, 2020               ; Check if their sum is 2020\n    je .found_pair              ; If so, exit the loop\n    inc r13                     ; Increment the inner loop variable\n    cmp r13, intarraylen        ; Check if we just reached the last number\n    jne .find_pair              ; If not, loop\n    inc r12                     ; If so, increment the outer loop variable\n    mov r13, r12                ; and set the inner loop variable to be one\n    inc r13                     ; one more\n    jmp .find_pair              ; Loop\n.found_pair:\n    ; Clear the following registers in case there is\n    ; data in the top 32 bits that will change the\n    ; numbers we will print\n    xor rsi, rsi\n    xor rdx, rdx\n    xor rcx, rcx\n    ; We have found the pair, so print them and their product out\n    lea rdi, [foundpairstr]     ; Load the address of the string into rdi\n    mov esi, [intarray+r12*4]   ; Load the first 4 byte number into esi\n    mov edx, [intarray+r13*4]   ; Load the second 4 byte number into edx\n    mov ecx, esi                ; Move the first number into ecx\n    imul ecx, edx               ; Multiply by edx to get their product\n    xor rax, rax                ; Clear rax (required by printf)\n    call printf                 ; Call printf\n\n    ; ...\n\nNote that we have to multiply the indices stored in r12 and r13 by 4 to\nget their byte offset in the integer array. Also note that when moving a 4\nbyte integer to a register, we must use the 4 byte version of the register;\nsuch as eax, esi, edx, and ecx above. Furthermore, when doing this,\nwe must make sure that the upper 4 bytes of the register do not impact our\nresults. We do not clear rax before our loop because we only ever work\nwith eax and thus never access the upper 4 bytes; however, in our printing\ncode, we must clear the 64 bit registers before moving the numbers into their\nlower 4 bytes so that the numbers we pass to printf are correct.\nIf your program doesn't print anything out, try placing foundpairstr at\nthe start of your .data section. I found that if I placed it last, the\nprintf call would not work. I am not sure why this is; if you have any idea,\nlet me know!\nConclusion\nIf you followed along with me, you now have working code to solve the first part\nof the Day 1 AOC challenge. I will leave the second part as an exercise; the code\nis very similar to that of part 1, except that the brute force solution has three\nnested loops instead of two. Because it is so similar, I highly recommend that you\nattempt to complete it yourself as an exercise. If you get stumped or just want the\nsolution, you can see my solution here.\nIf you are interested in learning more assembly, the following resources were\nincredibly helpful for me in learning the assembly and low level knowledge\nrequired for this article,\n\nAssembly Language Step by Step with Linux, Third Edition, by Jeff Duntemann\nBeginnning x86 Assembly Programming: From Novice to AVX Professional, by\nJoe Van Hoey\nThe Linux Man Pages\n\nIf you have any questions, problems, or feedback while following this\narticle, feel free to create an  issue\non my solutions repository or\nemail me directly.\n","id":"https://alidiusk.github.io/posts/aoc2020-asm/","title":"Completing Advent of Code 2020 Day 1 in x86-64 Assembly"}},"docInfo":{"https://alidiusk.github.io/":{"body":96,"title":1},"https://alidiusk.github.io/contact/":{"body":9,"title":1},"https://alidiusk.github.io/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://alidiusk.github.io/posts/aoc2020-asm/":{"body":3516,"title":9}},"length":4},"lang":"English"};
