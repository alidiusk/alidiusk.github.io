# Hi, I'm Maya Woodward.

I'm currently a junior at the University of Pittsburgh.
I'm majoring in Computer Science and planning to minor in Mathematics.
I enjoy reading, beekeeping, music, singing, walking, and high quality coffee.

I write a little bit. You can find my posts [here](@/posts/_index.md).

Lately I've been particularly interested in operating system development,
systems programming, Linux/Unix, and hardware. However, I also possess a
strong interest in programming language theory, parsing, and networking.

My favorite programming language is [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
I think that it is an excellent medium between low level control and
high level expressiveness, and I love its safety guarantees. The
outstanding tooling and community is a very nice cherry on top.

I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux),
and the [Bash shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) as my development
environment. If you're interested, my dotfiles are
[here](https://github.com/alidiusk/dotfiles).

You can [contact me](@/contact/_index.md) if you have any questions, want to talk,
or are interested in hiring me.
