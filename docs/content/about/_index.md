# I'm Liam Woodward.

I'm currently a freshman at the University of Pittsburgh. I'm majoring in Computer Science and planning to minor in Mathematics. I enjoy reading, beekeeping, singing, walking, and high quality coffee.

I spend a large portion of my free time working on my [projects](/projects). I'm currently most interested in learning about programming language design, including interpeters, compilers, type systems, programming paradigms, etc. My favorite language is currently Rust.
