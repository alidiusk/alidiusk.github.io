# Projects

You can access all of my projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/alidiusk).

These are the projects that I'm most proud of:
* [Rustulator](https://github.com/alidiusk/rustulator): A scientific calculator with both a command line REPL and a web frontend, written in Rust. It currently does not compile as it relied on some unstable Rust libraries, though I may go back and resolve this soon.
* [Notes](https://github.com/alidiusk/notes-rs): A command line notes manager written in Rust. I use this as my daily driver to remember interesting websites, or give myself reminders.
