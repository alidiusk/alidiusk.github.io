# Projects

You can access all of my projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/alidiusk).

These are the projects that I'm most proud of:
* [Rustulator](https://github.com/alidiusk/rustulator): A basic scientific calculator that can be used in both the command line and in the browser. The calculator, command line REPL, and web backend are written in Rust, and the web frontend is written in Elm.
* [Notes](https://github.com/alidiusk/notes-rs): A command line notes manager. I use this as my daily driver to remember interesting websites or give myself reminder. The entire application is written in Rust.
* [DiCast](https://github.com/alidiusk/DiCast): A dice roller application with a web interface that allows users to create new die rolls, name them, and roll them. Supports rolling an arbitray number of arbitrary dice, adding or multiplying constants, dropping a number of dice from the roll, and more. The dice roller, backend, and frontend are written in Rust. The frontend uses Rust-compiled WebAssembly using the Yew library.
* [lios](https://github.com/alidiusk/lios): A custom 32-bit operating system made from scratch that features a custom bootloader, keyboard input, VGA output to the screenm, an implementation of a subset of libc, a simple user shell, and memory allocation. Written in C and NASM.
* [alidiusk.github.io](https://github.com/alidiusk/alidiusk.github.io): This website, built using the static site generator Zola and hosted on GitHub pages. It's automatically built and deployed on git push using a GitHub Actions workflow.
